About Me

  
    Code and Innovate
    
      I'm a Computer Science scholar at NUML with a 3.60/4.0 CGPA, specializing in AI and full-stack development. My work focuses on creating scalable, intelligent systems using Django, FastAPI, and advanced neural networks. I'm passionate about solving complex problems, contributing to open-source projects, and excelling in hackathons.
    
    
      Currently, I'm building enterprise-grade web applications, advancing NLP research, and optimizing AI performance. Outside coding, I explore research papers and strategize tech innovations.
